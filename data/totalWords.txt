                                                                                       Mr Chief Justice and may it              please the Court                        Congress in the exercise of its plenary              authority over immigration enacted section a in                 to afford the Attorney General the authority              to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the day              removal period if they cannot be removed to their              countries of nationality or to some other country during              that day period                        That enactment was the culmination of measures              beginning in  by which Congress sought to address what              had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within              the United States  It was enacted against a background of              information in  in particular about both the high              rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the              very high rate of flight among aliens who are released                         Yes                          It does not no but what                the important element though is that future               dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain              someone  Under this Courts civil commitment cases and              this does not remotely resemble civil commitment because              its an exercise of Congress plenary power over              immigration but one of the bases on which someone may be              civilly committed is their potential dangerousness  Now              the Court                           No  Thats                           No it is in this important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             respect and think this is a critical factor to               understanding this case  What the Court said in               Hendricks for example is that in the civil commitment               cases the Court has said its dangerousness plus some               other factor such as mental illness                         Here we have a critical other factor in               addition to dangerousness and that is that both Mr Ma               and Mr Zadvydas in this case had had their right to               remain in this country extinguished                         Pardon me                         In our submission the detention              of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for              detention as long as there is a basis for concern about              threat to the community and removal                         Right                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Right                          It is not clear now                          Well                           That and in addition because of              the potential for dangerousness to the community                         Well                           Id like to answer that in two               respects  do not believe there is any reasonable time               limitation within the statute  On the other hand it               depends what you mean what could be comprehended within               the determination of reasonableness  mean for               example                            Well in this case the              attorney                           Yes                         The Attorney General has              implemented this statute in a way  maybe the Attorney              General had broader authority to detain someone              permanently without ever releasing someone but the              constitutional question before the court and the              statutory question for that matter has to be analyzed in              terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of              his discretion in establishing a review procedure under              which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight                          do not agree with it in this               respect  We do not believe it is for the courts to              determine whether at least in the first instance and              without a high degree of deference to the Attorney General              as to whether there is another country to whom the alien              might conceivably be returned in the future                         Im not  Im not                         That is our position but would              like to say something about the two aliens in this case              just to show that were not even near that position                        Contrary to Mr Zadvydass counsels position                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             that nothing has been done with respect to him recently               we point out at page  footnote  of our brief facts               have happened after the letter that he referred to that               Mr Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate                         As we point out in that brief the twice               last summer called Mr Zadvydas in for an appointment               after he asked that that appointment be postponed so it               could be explained to him what information the had               obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what              information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for              citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his              parents                        On both instances he did not show up for the              appointment so he is not cooperating with the known              procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has              identified as germane to the question of whether he would              be granted citizenship                         It is but the important purpose              of the detention here is to protect the community as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             prophylactic matter not simply to take measures against               someone after the fact                         Now having said that under the regulations               that Ive described even before the formal regulations               went in place in December up to  percent of the people               who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were               in place were released during that period of time so               these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity                            Im not  well all of them or              almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted              of a crime  Most of the people detained in this category              have a criminal history maybe a few who do not but the              two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a              crime in which they had all of the procedures to which              they were entitled in determining that and this Court has              said                           They have but as this Court              pointed out in the Jones case which was discussed in              Foucha it is permissible for a State to presume              continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence               does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness                          Oh think there are several                think the Mezei case does                          But it is our submission that              once an alien has been ordered removed from the country              as both of the aliens here have been  not only have they              had a criminal conviction with all the protection that              affords but they have  are subject to final orders of              removal under an administrative process in which that had              be proven by clear and convincing evidence                        The procedures are unquestioned in this case               The consequence of the final order of removal                           Theres not and if may explain               why there is no difference from the point of view of the               status or the interests of the alien there is no               difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the               United States and there is no difference                            Im speaking of the legal status              of the alien and the third is with respect to the              interests of the United States                        With respect to the status of the alien its              important to consider the consequences of a final order of              removal  It is not simply an order of removal  It also              terminates the persons status as a lawful permanent              resident                         If may this does not rest on a               legal fiction                         The first thing would like to point out is               just to finish the  because this is important to               answering the question  to finish the consequences of a               final order of removal the first thing it does as               mentioned is it terminates the status of an alien               lawfully admitted for permanent residence                             which is defined as a              privilege of being lawfully admitted such status not              having changed and as we point out in our brief                           Right  but then the further              consequence is under a of the act the alien is              inadmissible for  years or in the case of an              aggravated felon like these for  years so that                           So that person is                           But what  the point Im              trying to make is in terms of his legal status he is in              exactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the               border someone who has no rights                            No it does not but the              important thing about  the important thing to consider              if you look at someone like Mezei who was here for               years and went abroad for think  months before he              came back in the Court said that he was an arriving              alien even though he had a long time in this country but              the important point is that Mezei was about procedure and              what the Court was relying on in the socalled entry              fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded               on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown               to the alien                         Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei               rejected the notion that there was a substantive due               process problem with detaining Mezei                            And here                           No  and the other part of              Mezei that was the part of Mezei that depended on the              entry fiction but the other part of Mezei is he had no              liberty interest to be at large in the United States and              our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in              the United States was extinguished by the final order of              removal                         Absolutely                          Absolutely                            Not at all                            That was exactly the point was               going to make  One could make the same point here with               respect to the removal of an alien who was previously              here and whose right to remain here has been              extinguished                        The United States would not do this but one way              to remove the alien from the United States would be to put              him on a boat or to insist that he find a county and              unless he finds a country he will be detained here                         Theres not a precedent put               this  put that way but if may respond the basis for              the removal order in this case were criminal convictions              in which the aliens criminal trials                           But                           No but you said where the basis              for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial               Here there was a criminal trial                         Well                            Well with all respect the               criminal conviction in this case in both of these cases              and in the great majority of cases in which people are              being detained plays a critical role in their continued              detention                        This was something that the Court found to be a              permissible factor in both Foucha and in  and              particularly in Jones where the Court said that there              could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject              to rebuttal by the individual which is exactly what we              have here                         Okay                          Okay                          Several  The first is Fong Yue               Ting which says                           Fong Fong Yue think it              is Yue Ting Ting which says that Congress power              over  power to expel aliens in other words to deport              them is the same and is as absolute as Congress power to              exclude aliens and weve set out the relevant quote in              our brief in the Zadvydas case which believe is at              pages  and                         So think that is an important constitutional              basis for the point was making earlier that once              someones right to remain here is extinguished and hes              put back in that status it is proper to equate them to              Mezei                        The next line of cases that would point to are              cases in particular that  civil commitment cases              where the Court has think contemplated that there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             could be subsequent determinations following on a               presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of               continuing dangerousness                          No but it seems to me another               important point that the Court has said with respect to              aliens and this cant remember the case in particular              but the Court has said on a number of occasions that              Congress can commit the determination of immigration              matters to the executive branch and have determinations              made                           Well                           believe thats correct                         No but with respect to its               fundamental point that the Congress                           Precisely                         That is exactly                           That is                           Right and the point is that              a enacted pursuant to Congress plenary power              vests the release authority in the discretion of the              Attorney General and so it would be odd in that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There is habeas corpus review                We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held               subject to the Attorney Generals authority under the               statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the               constitutionality of the detention so if there is an               argument                            Well if there is  constitutional              review of the individualized determination it would only              be along the lines of what the Supreme  of what this              Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores which              would be whether the Attorney Generals determination was              arbitrary                         That is correct                          Right and those                            That is right so  and the              important point is for these purposes                           Were certainly not saying there              is no access to habeas corpus to challenge the              constitutionality of the detention                         think you are correct the alien              will under our submission lose at least or in the              exceptional case in that circumstance but thats because              Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate              question of deciding when an alien should be released and              not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This  in this area like in so many areas of               immigration this is intimately tied up with foreign               relations  As we point in our briefs with respect to Mr               Ma for example we are engaged in negotiations with               Southeast Asian countries                            We believe there is not that               under aBii of title it bars judicial              review of anything any determinations that are committed              to the discretion of the Attorney General                         Administrative process is good               enough and the first and basic point is the one that               Justice Scalia said which is that the most important               ingredient of liberty interests at stake here was               extinguished the right to be at large in the United               States was extinguished in the administrative deportation               proceeding                             subject to judicial review if              the alien chose it and the aliens in this case did not              seek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty              interests                         take it to be that theres no              liberty interest is my                           But that think cannot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That think cannot be correct               at least if one looks at Wong Wing which prohibited the               service  imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was               in the United States                         It is no part of our submission that an alien               who is illegally present or who has been paroled into the               United States in a case like Mezei is not a person for              purposes of protection independent of the immigration              laws but its quite a different matter to say that the              Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress              plenary power to protect the United States and the safety              of the United States                        One other point that Id like to make because              its important to bear in mind protecting the safety of              the citizens of the United States and the community is not              ancillary to or simply incidental to an immigration              consequence  It is part of the whole point of removal of              the aliens in this situation that they were as Justice              Scalia pointed out essentially in this country              conditioned upon their compliance with our laws   They              broke our laws they committed crimes and they  and              committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a              danger to the community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Well it is very likely to factor              in to another countrys calculus of how willing they will              be to take someone back whether that person is in custody              or not because  the Court pointed out in Mezei that              Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such              as Mezei arrives at our borders that person is no more              our problem than the other country s                        With respect to an alien and his own country of              nationality his liberty is that countrys responsibility              not ours rather than ours                         Thats                            It goes beyond the excludable               class because if a foreign dictator realized that he               could cause the release into this country at large of               nationals of that country simply by refusing to take               people back                            But that status has been              extinguished and they have no right to remain here and              they do have a right under international law to                           Maybe not dumping in the first              instance but what the refusal to take someone back  and              we  for example with respect to Cuba we have a number              of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who              we want to remove from our midst not simply those who              were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift and if we                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             have a foreign dictator                            Well its we dont want them any               more and it is your responsibility to take him back and              the pressures on that other country not simply from the              United States Government but from the alien himself from              human rights groups from his family are much greater for              that other country to take him back when hes in              detention                         Thats                           That is correct as weve seen                          That is correct as were                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             seeing                            Pardon me                          Well it depends on  a lot of               the aliens here are not released  mean they had              previously to report                           The Attorney General  first of              all questions such as this we think are committed to the              discretion of the Attorney General                        As we point out in our brief the Attorney              General in issuing the final regulations in December              pointed out that had commissioned a study of other              methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be              released to see if theres some middle ground halfway              houses and things like that and the notice points out              that the is going to be expanding that program to see              whether there are alternatives but                           No  The aliens in this case are               certainly not seeking house arrest  They are seeking               being released under some degree of supervision but they               are                            Yes  We certainly think it would              give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the              person be released into a program a halfway house or a              drug treatment program and that also is pointed out in              the preamble to the new regulations but we dont              believe                           It could be but the questions of              exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in are              mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney              General under laws passed by Congress to administer the              immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             should be kept in while theyre being detained                          Im not sure of all of them but               there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving               the jurisdiction                          What the Attorney General has              concluded is for people who do not pose a threat to the              community  reporting requirements are not going to stop              someone from being a threat to the community  They may              guard against flight but they are a far more inadequate              protection against danger to the community                         Yes but the important  the              balance of interest is completely different with respect              to a citizen and an alien who not only                           Because under Salerno for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             example the Court said that an individuals interest in               liberty can be outweighed by important governmental               interests                         There is a compelling interest in protecting the               safety of the community but where the liberty interest               that is going to be                            But the countervailing liberty              interest is far far less to the extent the alien has any              remaining liberty interest because his right to be at              large in the United States has been extinguished                         There is not  As we say were              not challenging                           Well as we say were not              challenging the ability for habeas corpus review  If that              was an issue the proper disposition would be to allow                          Well if there was going to be               judicial review it would be along the lines of Carlson               which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that               power arbitrarily  We think there probably  might be a               constitutional component to that to the extent the Court              concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at              all  That would be the proper way to address this not to              attack as a substantive due process matter which is all              thats here                         Yes                         Under Carlson                           Yes  think under Carlson there              was review of those individualized custody determinations                         No that is absolutely correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             but the  again coming back to the central issue in this               case all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney               Generals detention pursuant to expressed statutory               authority is reasonably related to the goals that have               been advanced and as long as the person was found by the               Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk the               detention is reasonably related and that detention is               subject to periodic automatic review by the Attorney               General every year and in intervening periods the alien              can request a review of his status by presenting changed              material circumstances                        In that situation we think that is a very              reasonable response on behalf of the two political              branches about how to deal with the severe problem of              dangerous criminal aliens in our midst                        It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of              every nation to protect itself against aliens who that              nation does not believe should be in its presence for              purposes of national sovereignty national security but              also the safety of the populace of that country and that              is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding              to                        Safety is not simply a question to be addressed              by the States  When it comes to aliens in this country              it is Congress responsibility not that of the States or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             in addition to that of the States to protect the populace               of the United States against the presence of dangerous               criminal aliens in the United States and that is what has               been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and               administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied               due process and the only remaining  in terms of giving               Congress an interest with respect to aliens it is the               equivalent of a States interest with respect to the               mentally ill                        In that situation it is directly parallel to              the interests of a State  When does a State come in and              intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an              individual  With respect to civil commitment it is in              the context of mental illness which gives the State a              right to come in and look after the individual and protect              the individual and the State  With respect to aliens it              is Congress plenary power                        That has been satisfied  That has been              permanently extinguished that liberty interest  All that              remains then is the question of dangerousness and as              this Court has held in the civil commitment cases a State              may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no              longer dangerous at the end of a particular period                        There have been no questions here about the              statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             aliens but we think it is clear that the Attorney General               has that authority conferred by Congress                         



                                                                                       Mr Chief Justice and may it              please the Court                        Congress in the exercise of its plenary              authority over immigration enacted section a in                 to afford the Attorney General the authority              to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the day              removal period if they cannot be removed to their              countries of nationality or to some other country during              that day period                        That enactment was the culmination of measures              beginning in  by which Congress sought to address what              had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within              the United States  It was enacted against a background of              information in  in particular about both the high              rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the              very high rate of flight among aliens who are released                         Yes                          It does not no but what                the important element though is that future               dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain              someone  Under this Courts civil commitment cases and              this does not remotely resemble civil commitment because              its an exercise of Congress plenary power over              immigration but one of the bases on which someone may be              civilly committed is their potential dangerousness  Now              the Court                           No  Thats                           No it is in this important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             respect and think this is a critical factor to               understanding this case  What the Court said in               Hendricks for example is that in the civil commitment               cases the Court has said its dangerousness plus some               other factor such as mental illness                         Here we have a critical other factor in               addition to dangerousness and that is that both Mr Ma               and Mr Zadvydas in this case had had their right to               remain in this country extinguished                         Pardon me                         In our submission the detention              of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for              detention as long as there is a basis for concern about              threat to the community and removal                         Right                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Right                          It is not clear now                          Well                           That and in addition because of              the potential for dangerousness to the community                         Well                           Id like to answer that in two               respects  do not believe there is any reasonable time               limitation within the statute  On the other hand it               depends what you mean what could be comprehended within               the determination of reasonableness  mean for               example                            Well in this case the              attorney                           Yes                         The Attorney General has              implemented this statute in a way  maybe the Attorney              General had broader authority to detain someone              permanently without ever releasing someone but the              constitutional question before the court and the              statutory question for that matter has to be analyzed in              terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of              his discretion in establishing a review procedure under              which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight                          do not agree with it in this               respect  We do not believe it is for the courts to              determine whether at least in the first instance and              without a high degree of deference to the Attorney General              as to whether there is another country to whom the alien              might conceivably be returned in the future                         Im not  Im not                         That is our position but would              like to say something about the two aliens in this case              just to show that were not even near that position                        Contrary to Mr Zadvydass counsels position                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             that nothing has been done with respect to him recently               we point out at page  footnote  of our brief facts               have happened after the letter that he referred to that               Mr Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate                         As we point out in that brief the twice               last summer called Mr Zadvydas in for an appointment               after he asked that that appointment be postponed so it               could be explained to him what information the had               obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what              information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for              citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his              parents                        On both instances he did not show up for the              appointment so he is not cooperating with the known              procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has              identified as germane to the question of whether he would              be granted citizenship                         It is but the important purpose              of the detention here is to protect the community as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             prophylactic matter not simply to take measures against               someone after the fact                         Now having said that under the regulations               that Ive described even before the formal regulations               went in place in December up to  percent of the people               who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were               in place were released during that period of time so               these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity                            Im not  well all of them or              almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted              of a crime  Most of the people detained in this category              have a criminal history maybe a few who do not but the              two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a              crime in which they had all of the procedures to which              they were entitled in determining that and this Court has              said                           They have but as this Court              pointed out in the Jones case which was discussed in              Foucha it is permissible for a State to presume              continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence               does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness                          Oh think there are several                think the Mezei case does                          But it is our submission that              once an alien has been ordered removed from the country              as both of the aliens here have been  not only have they              had a criminal conviction with all the protection that              affords but they have  are subject to final orders of              removal under an administrative process in which that had              be proven by clear and convincing evidence                        The procedures are unquestioned in this case               The consequence of the final order of removal                           Theres not and if may explain               why there is no difference from the point of view of the               status or the interests of the alien there is no               difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the               United States and there is no difference                            Im speaking of the legal status              of the alien and the third is with respect to the              interests of the United States                        With respect to the status of the alien its              important to consider the consequences of a final order of              removal  It is not simply an order of removal  It also              terminates the persons status as a lawful permanent              resident                         If may this does not rest on a               legal fiction                         The first thing would like to point out is               just to finish the  because this is important to               answering the question  to finish the consequences of a               final order of removal the first thing it does as               mentioned is it terminates the status of an alien               lawfully admitted for permanent residence                             which is defined as a              privilege of being lawfully admitted such status not              having changed and as we point out in our brief                           Right  but then the further              consequence is under a of the act the alien is              inadmissible for  years or in the case of an              aggravated felon like these for  years so that                           So that person is                           But what  the point Im              trying to make is in terms of his legal status he is in              exactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the               border someone who has no rights                            No it does not but the              important thing about  the important thing to consider              if you look at someone like Mezei who was here for               years and went abroad for think  months before he              came back in the Court said that he was an arriving              alien even though he had a long time in this country but              the important point is that Mezei was about procedure and              what the Court was relying on in the socalled entry              fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded               on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown               to the alien                         Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei               rejected the notion that there was a substantive due               process problem with detaining Mezei                            And here                           No  and the other part of              Mezei that was the part of Mezei that depended on the              entry fiction but the other part of Mezei is he had no              liberty interest to be at large in the United States and              our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in              the United States was extinguished by the final order of              removal                         Absolutely                          Absolutely                            Not at all                            That was exactly the point was               going to make  One could make the same point here with               respect to the removal of an alien who was previously              here and whose right to remain here has been              extinguished                        The United States would not do this but one way              to remove the alien from the United States would be to put              him on a boat or to insist that he find a county and              unless he finds a country he will be detained here                         Theres not a precedent put               this  put that way but if may respond the basis for              the removal order in this case were criminal convictions              in which the aliens criminal trials                           But                           No but you said where the basis              for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial               Here there was a criminal trial                         Well                            Well with all respect the               criminal conviction in this case in both of these cases              and in the great majority of cases in which people are              being detained plays a critical role in their continued              detention                        This was something that the Court found to be a              permissible factor in both Foucha and in  and              particularly in Jones where the Court said that there              could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject              to rebuttal by the individual which is exactly what we              have here                         Okay                          Okay                          Several  The first is Fong Yue               Ting which says                           Fong Fong Yue think it              is Yue Ting Ting which says that Congress power              over  power to expel aliens in other words to deport              them is the same and is as absolute as Congress power to              exclude aliens and weve set out the relevant quote in              our brief in the Zadvydas case which believe is at              pages  and                         So think that is an important constitutional              basis for the point was making earlier that once              someones right to remain here is extinguished and hes              put back in that status it is proper to equate them to              Mezei                        The next line of cases that would point to are              cases in particular that  civil commitment cases              where the Court has think contemplated that there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             could be subsequent determinations following on a               presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of               continuing dangerousness                          No but it seems to me another               important point that the Court has said with respect to              aliens and this cant remember the case in particular              but the Court has said on a number of occasions that              Congress can commit the determination of immigration              matters to the executive branch and have determinations              made                           Well                           believe thats correct                         No but with respect to its               fundamental point that the Congress                           Precisely                         That is exactly                           That is                           Right and the point is that              a enacted pursuant to Congress plenary power              vests the release authority in the discretion of the              Attorney General and so it would be odd in that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There is habeas corpus review                We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held               subject to the Attorney Generals authority under the               statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the               constitutionality of the detention so if there is an               argument                            Well if there is  constitutional              review of the individualized determination it would only              be along the lines of what the Supreme  of what this              Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores which              would be whether the Attorney Generals determination was              arbitrary                         That is correct                          Right and those                            That is right so  and the              important point is for these purposes                           Were certainly not saying there              is no access to habeas corpus to challenge the              constitutionality of the detention                         think you are correct the alien              will under our submission lose at least or in the              exceptional case in that circumstance but thats because              Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate              question of deciding when an alien should be released and              not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This  in this area like in so many areas of               immigration this is intimately tied up with foreign               relations  As we point in our briefs with respect to Mr               Ma for example we are engaged in negotiations with               Southeast Asian countries                            We believe there is not that               under aBii of title it bars judicial              review of anything any determinations that are committed              to the discretion of the Attorney General                         Administrative process is good               enough and the first and basic point is the one that               Justice Scalia said which is that the most important               ingredient of liberty interests at stake here was               extinguished the right to be at large in the United               States was extinguished in the administrative deportation               proceeding                             subject to judicial review if              the alien chose it and the aliens in this case did not              seek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty              interests                         take it to be that theres no              liberty interest is my                           But that think cannot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That think cannot be correct               at least if one looks at Wong Wing which prohibited the               service  imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was               in the United States                         It is no part of our submission that an alien               who is illegally present or who has been paroled into the               United States in a case like Mezei is not a person for              purposes of protection independent of the immigration              laws but its quite a different matter to say that the              Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress              plenary power to protect the United States and the safety              of the United States                        One other point that Id like to make because              its important to bear in mind protecting the safety of              the citizens of the United States and the community is not              ancillary to or simply incidental to an immigration              consequence  It is part of the whole point of removal of              the aliens in this situation that they were as Justice              Scalia pointed out essentially in this country              conditioned upon their compliance with our laws   They              broke our laws they committed crimes and they  and              committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a              danger to the community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Well it is very likely to factor              in to another countrys calculus of how willing they will              be to take someone back whether that person is in custody              or not because  the Court pointed out in Mezei that              Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such              as Mezei arrives at our borders that person is no more              our problem than the other country s                        With respect to an alien and his own country of              nationality his liberty is that countrys responsibility              not ours rather than ours                         Thats                            It goes beyond the excludable               class because if a foreign dictator realized that he               could cause the release into this country at large of               nationals of that country simply by refusing to take               people back                            But that status has been              extinguished and they have no right to remain here and              they do have a right under international law to                           Maybe not dumping in the first              instance but what the refusal to take someone back  and              we  for example with respect to Cuba we have a number              of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who              we want to remove from our midst not simply those who              were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift and if we                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             have a foreign dictator                            Well its we dont want them any               more and it is your responsibility to take him back and              the pressures on that other country not simply from the              United States Government but from the alien himself from              human rights groups from his family are much greater for              that other country to take him back when hes in              detention                         Thats                           That is correct as weve seen                          That is correct as were                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             seeing                            Pardon me                          Well it depends on  a lot of               the aliens here are not released  mean they had              previously to report                           The Attorney General  first of              all questions such as this we think are committed to the              discretion of the Attorney General                        As we point out in our brief the Attorney              General in issuing the final regulations in December              pointed out that had commissioned a study of other              methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be              released to see if theres some middle ground halfway              houses and things like that and the notice points out              that the is going to be expanding that program to see              whether there are alternatives but                           No  The aliens in this case are               certainly not seeking house arrest  They are seeking               being released under some degree of supervision but they               are                            Yes  We certainly think it would              give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the              person be released into a program a halfway house or a              drug treatment program and that also is pointed out in              the preamble to the new regulations but we dont              believe                           It could be but the questions of              exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in are              mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney              General under laws passed by Congress to administer the              immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             should be kept in while theyre being detained                          Im not sure of all of them but               there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving               the jurisdiction                          What the Attorney General has              concluded is for people who do not pose a threat to the              community  reporting requirements are not going to stop              someone from being a threat to the community  They may              guard against flight but they are a far more inadequate              protection against danger to the community                         Yes but the important  the              balance of interest is completely different with respect              to a citizen and an alien who not only                           Because under Salerno for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             example the Court said that an individuals interest in               liberty can be outweighed by important governmental               interests                         There is a compelling interest in protecting the               safety of the community but where the liberty interest               that is going to be                            But the countervailing liberty              interest is far far less to the extent the alien has any              remaining liberty interest because his right to be at              large in the United States has been extinguished                         There is not  As we say were              not challenging                           Well as we say were not              challenging the ability for habeas corpus review  If that              was an issue the proper disposition would be to allow                          Well if there was going to be               judicial review it would be along the lines of Carlson               which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that               power arbitrarily  We think there probably  might be a               constitutional component to that to the extent the Court              concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at              all  That would be the proper way to address this not to              attack as a substantive due process matter which is all              thats here                         Yes                         Under Carlson                           Yes  think under Carlson there              was review of those individualized custody determinations                         No that is absolutely correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             but the  again coming back to the central issue in this               case all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney               Generals detention pursuant to expressed statutory               authority is reasonably related to the goals that have               been advanced and as long as the person was found by the               Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk the               detention is reasonably related and that detention is               subject to periodic automatic review by the Attorney               General every year and in intervening periods the alien              can request a review of his status by presenting changed              material circumstances                        In that situation we think that is a very              reasonable response on behalf of the two political              branches about how to deal with the severe problem of              dangerous criminal aliens in our midst                        It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of              every nation to protect itself against aliens who that              nation does not believe should be in its presence for              purposes of national sovereignty national security but              also the safety of the populace of that country and that              is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding              to                        Safety is not simply a question to be addressed              by the States  When it comes to aliens in this country              it is Congress responsibility not that of the States or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             in addition to that of the States to protect the populace               of the United States against the presence of dangerous               criminal aliens in the United States and that is what has               been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and               administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied               due process and the only remaining  in terms of giving               Congress an interest with respect to aliens it is the               equivalent of a States interest with respect to the               mentally ill                        In that situation it is directly parallel to              the interests of a State  When does a State come in and              intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an              individual  With respect to civil commitment it is in              the context of mental illness which gives the State a              right to come in and look after the individual and protect              the individual and the State  With respect to aliens it              is Congress plenary power                        That has been satisfied  That has been              permanently extinguished that liberty interest  All that              remains then is the question of dangerousness and as              this Court has held in the civil commitment cases a State              may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no              longer dangerous at the end of a particular period                        There have been no questions here about the              statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             aliens but we think it is clear that the Attorney General               has that authority conferred by Congress                                                                                                                Mr Chief Justice and may it              please the Court                        Congress in the exercise of its plenary              authority over immigration enacted section a in                 to afford the Attorney General the authority              to detain dangerous criminal aliens beyond the day              removal period if they cannot be removed to their              countries of nationality or to some other country during              that day period                        That enactment was the culmination of measures              beginning in  by which Congress sought to address what              had become the serious problem of criminal aliens within              the United States  It was enacted against a background of              information in  in particular about both the high              rate of recidivism among criminal aliens as well as the              very high rate of flight among aliens who are released                         Yes                          It does not no but what                the important element though is that future               dangerousness is a legitimate basis on which to detain              someone  Under this Courts civil commitment cases and              this does not remotely resemble civil commitment because              its an exercise of Congress plenary power over              immigration but one of the bases on which someone may be              civilly committed is their potential dangerousness  Now              the Court                           No  Thats                           No it is in this important                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             respect and think this is a critical factor to               understanding this case  What the Court said in               Hendricks for example is that in the civil commitment               cases the Court has said its dangerousness plus some               other factor such as mental illness                         Here we have a critical other factor in               addition to dangerousness and that is that both Mr Ma               and Mr Zadvydas in this case had had their right to               remain in this country extinguished                         Pardon me                         In our submission the detention              of the aliens is reasonably related to the basis for              detention as long as there is a basis for concern about              threat to the community and removal                         Right                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Right                          It is not clear now                          Well                           That and in addition because of              the potential for dangerousness to the community                         Well                           Id like to answer that in two               respects  do not believe there is any reasonable time               limitation within the statute  On the other hand it               depends what you mean what could be comprehended within               the determination of reasonableness  mean for               example                            Well in this case the              attorney                           Yes                         The Attorney General has              implemented this statute in a way  maybe the Attorney              General had broader authority to detain someone              permanently without ever releasing someone but the              constitutional question before the court and the              statutory question for that matter has to be analyzed in              terms of what the Attorney General did in the exercise of              his discretion in establishing a review procedure under              which the alien is subject to periodic review to determine                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             whether he is either dangerous or a risk of flight                          do not agree with it in this               respect  We do not believe it is for the courts to              determine whether at least in the first instance and              without a high degree of deference to the Attorney General              as to whether there is another country to whom the alien              might conceivably be returned in the future                         Im not  Im not                         That is our position but would              like to say something about the two aliens in this case              just to show that were not even near that position                        Contrary to Mr Zadvydass counsels position                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             that nothing has been done with respect to him recently               we point out at page  footnote  of our brief facts               have happened after the letter that he referred to that               Mr Zadvydas wrote to the Lithuanian consulate                         As we point out in that brief the twice               last summer called Mr Zadvydas in for an appointment               after he asked that that appointment be postponed so it               could be explained to him what information the had               obtained from the Lithuanian consulate as to what              information would be necessary to apply to Lithuania for              citizenship based on the Lithuanian citizenship of his              parents                        On both instances he did not show up for the              appointment so he is not cooperating with the known              procedures for submission of documents that Lithuania has              identified as germane to the question of whether he would              be granted citizenship                         It is but the important purpose              of the detention here is to protect the community as a                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             prophylactic matter not simply to take measures against               someone after the fact                         Now having said that under the regulations               that Ive described even before the formal regulations               went in place in December up to  percent of the people               who were reviewed under the interim procedures that were               in place were released during that period of time so               these regulations do afford a periodic opportunity                            Im not  well all of them or              almost all of them in the sense that they were convicted              of a crime  Most of the people detained in this category              have a criminal history maybe a few who do not but the              two aliens before the Court right now were convicted of a              crime in which they had all of the procedures to which              they were entitled in determining that and this Court has              said                           They have but as this Court              pointed out in the Jones case which was discussed in              Foucha it is permissible for a State to presume              continuing dangerousness from the conviction of a crime                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             and the fact that someone has served a criminal sentence               does not remove the inference of continuing dangerousness                          Oh think there are several                think the Mezei case does                          But it is our submission that              once an alien has been ordered removed from the country              as both of the aliens here have been  not only have they              had a criminal conviction with all the protection that              affords but they have  are subject to final orders of              removal under an administrative process in which that had              be proven by clear and convincing evidence                        The procedures are unquestioned in this case               The consequence of the final order of removal                           Theres not and if may explain               why there is no difference from the point of view of the               status or the interests of the alien there is no               difference with respect to the sovereign powers of the               United States and there is no difference                            Im speaking of the legal status              of the alien and the third is with respect to the              interests of the United States                        With respect to the status of the alien its              important to consider the consequences of a final order of              removal  It is not simply an order of removal  It also              terminates the persons status as a lawful permanent              resident                         If may this does not rest on a               legal fiction                         The first thing would like to point out is               just to finish the  because this is important to               answering the question  to finish the consequences of a               final order of removal the first thing it does as               mentioned is it terminates the status of an alien               lawfully admitted for permanent residence                             which is defined as a              privilege of being lawfully admitted such status not              having changed and as we point out in our brief                           Right  but then the further              consequence is under a of the act the alien is              inadmissible for  years or in the case of an              aggravated felon like these for  years so that                           So that person is                           But what  the point Im              trying to make is in terms of his legal status he is in              exactly the same legal status under the laws Congress has                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             passed to protect this Nation as someone who is at the               border someone who has no rights                            No it does not but the              important thing about  the important thing to consider              if you look at someone like Mezei who was here for               years and went abroad for think  months before he              came back in the Court said that he was an arriving              alien even though he had a long time in this country but              the important point is that Mezei was about procedure and              what the Court was relying on in the socalled entry              fiction there was the fact that it was the Court sustained                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             the authority of the Attorney General to keep him excluded               on the basis of classified evidence that was never shown               to the alien                         Even Justice Jackson in his dissent in Mezei               rejected the notion that there was a substantive due               process problem with detaining Mezei                            And here                           No  and the other part of              Mezei that was the part of Mezei that depended on the              entry fiction but the other part of Mezei is he had no              liberty interest to be at large in the United States and              our point is that that liberty interest to be at large in              the United States was extinguished by the final order of              removal                         Absolutely                          Absolutely                            Not at all                            That was exactly the point was               going to make  One could make the same point here with               respect to the removal of an alien who was previously              here and whose right to remain here has been              extinguished                        The United States would not do this but one way              to remove the alien from the United States would be to put              him on a boat or to insist that he find a county and              unless he finds a country he will be detained here                         Theres not a precedent put               this  put that way but if may respond the basis for              the removal order in this case were criminal convictions              in which the aliens criminal trials                           But                           No but you said where the basis              for the detention is not preceded by any criminal trial               Here there was a criminal trial                         Well                            Well with all respect the               criminal conviction in this case in both of these cases              and in the great majority of cases in which people are              being detained plays a critical role in their continued              detention                        This was something that the Court found to be a              permissible factor in both Foucha and in  and              particularly in Jones where the Court said that there              could be a presumption of continuing dangerousness subject              to rebuttal by the individual which is exactly what we              have here                         Okay                          Okay                          Several  The first is Fong Yue               Ting which says                           Fong Fong Yue think it              is Yue Ting Ting which says that Congress power              over  power to expel aliens in other words to deport              them is the same and is as absolute as Congress power to              exclude aliens and weve set out the relevant quote in              our brief in the Zadvydas case which believe is at              pages  and                         So think that is an important constitutional              basis for the point was making earlier that once              someones right to remain here is extinguished and hes              put back in that status it is proper to equate them to              Mezei                        The next line of cases that would point to are              cases in particular that  civil commitment cases              where the Court has think contemplated that there                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             could be subsequent determinations following on a               presumption coming out of a criminal conviction of               continuing dangerousness                          No but it seems to me another               important point that the Court has said with respect to              aliens and this cant remember the case in particular              but the Court has said on a number of occasions that              Congress can commit the determination of immigration              matters to the executive branch and have determinations              made                           Well                           believe thats correct                         No but with respect to its               fundamental point that the Congress                           Precisely                         That is exactly                           That is                           Right and the point is that              a enacted pursuant to Congress plenary power              vests the release authority in the discretion of the              Attorney General and so it would be odd in that                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          There is habeas corpus review                We do not challenge the right of an alien who is held               subject to the Attorney Generals authority under the               statute to seek habeas corpus challenging the               constitutionality of the detention so if there is an               argument                            Well if there is  constitutional              review of the individualized determination it would only              be along the lines of what the Supreme  of what this              Court said in Carlson and reiterated in Flores which              would be whether the Attorney Generals determination was              arbitrary                         That is correct                          Right and those                            That is right so  and the              important point is for these purposes                           Were certainly not saying there              is no access to habeas corpus to challenge the              constitutionality of the detention                         think you are correct the alien              will under our submission lose at least or in the              exceptional case in that circumstance but thats because              Congress has vested in the Attorney General the delicate              question of deciding when an alien should be released and              not                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       This  in this area like in so many areas of               immigration this is intimately tied up with foreign               relations  As we point in our briefs with respect to Mr               Ma for example we are engaged in negotiations with               Southeast Asian countries                            We believe there is not that               under aBii of title it bars judicial              review of anything any determinations that are committed              to the discretion of the Attorney General                         Administrative process is good               enough and the first and basic point is the one that               Justice Scalia said which is that the most important               ingredient of liberty interests at stake here was               extinguished the right to be at large in the United               States was extinguished in the administrative deportation               proceeding                             subject to judicial review if              the alien chose it and the aliens in this case did not              seek to challenge the extinguishment of their liberty              interests                         take it to be that theres no              liberty interest is my                           But that think cannot                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          That think cannot be correct               at least if one looks at Wong Wing which prohibited the               service  imprisonment and hard labor for someone who was               in the United States                         It is no part of our submission that an alien               who is illegally present or who has been paroled into the               United States in a case like Mezei is not a person for              purposes of protection independent of the immigration              laws but its quite a different matter to say that the              Due Process Clause was somehow intended to limit Congress              plenary power to protect the United States and the safety              of the United States                        One other point that Id like to make because              its important to bear in mind protecting the safety of              the citizens of the United States and the community is not              ancillary to or simply incidental to an immigration              consequence  It is part of the whole point of removal of              the aliens in this situation that they were as Justice              Scalia pointed out essentially in this country              conditioned upon their compliance with our laws   They              broke our laws they committed crimes and they  and              committed crimes that demonstrate that they present a              danger to the community                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        Well it is very likely to factor              in to another countrys calculus of how willing they will              be to take someone back whether that person is in custody              or not because  the Court pointed out in Mezei that              Congress could reasonably conclude that when an alien such              as Mezei arrives at our borders that person is no more              our problem than the other country s                        With respect to an alien and his own country of              nationality his liberty is that countrys responsibility              not ours rather than ours                         Thats                            It goes beyond the excludable               class because if a foreign dictator realized that he               could cause the release into this country at large of               nationals of that country simply by refusing to take               people back                            But that status has been              extinguished and they have no right to remain here and              they do have a right under international law to                           Maybe not dumping in the first              instance but what the refusal to take someone back  and              we  for example with respect to Cuba we have a number              of people who have come to Cuba and are here lawfully who              we want to remove from our midst not simply those who              were foisted upon us under the Mariel boat lift and if we                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             have a foreign dictator                            Well its we dont want them any               more and it is your responsibility to take him back and              the pressures on that other country not simply from the              United States Government but from the alien himself from              human rights groups from his family are much greater for              that other country to take him back when hes in              detention                         Thats                           That is correct as weve seen                          That is correct as were                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             seeing                            Pardon me                          Well it depends on  a lot of               the aliens here are not released  mean they had              previously to report                           The Attorney General  first of              all questions such as this we think are committed to the              discretion of the Attorney General                        As we point out in our brief the Attorney              General in issuing the final regulations in December              pointed out that had commissioned a study of other              methods for supervision of aliens who might safely be              released to see if theres some middle ground halfway              houses and things like that and the notice points out              that the is going to be expanding that program to see              whether there are alternatives but                           No  The aliens in this case are               certainly not seeking house arrest  They are seeking               being released under some degree of supervision but they               are                            Yes  We certainly think it would              give the Attorney General the authority to insist that the              person be released into a program a halfway house or a              drug treatment program and that also is pointed out in              the preamble to the new regulations but we dont              believe                           It could be but the questions of              exactly what form of custody to keep an alien in are              mixed up with the broader responsibilities of the Attorney              General under laws passed by Congress to administer the              immigration laws in terms of what facilities someone                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             should be kept in while theyre being detained                          Im not sure of all of them but               there are periodic reporting requirements and not leaving               the jurisdiction                          What the Attorney General has              concluded is for people who do not pose a threat to the              community  reporting requirements are not going to stop              someone from being a threat to the community  They may              guard against flight but they are a far more inadequate              protection against danger to the community                         Yes but the important  the              balance of interest is completely different with respect              to a citizen and an alien who not only                           Because under Salerno for                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             example the Court said that an individuals interest in               liberty can be outweighed by important governmental               interests                         There is a compelling interest in protecting the               safety of the community but where the liberty interest               that is going to be                            But the countervailing liberty              interest is far far less to the extent the alien has any              remaining liberty interest because his right to be at              large in the United States has been extinguished                         There is not  As we say were              not challenging                           Well as we say were not              challenging the ability for habeas corpus review  If that              was an issue the proper disposition would be to allow                          Well if there was going to be               judicial review it would be along the lines of Carlson               which is whether the Attorney General has exercised that               power arbitrarily  We think there probably  might be a               constitutional component to that to the extent the Court              concludes that there is any residual liberty interest at              all  That would be the proper way to address this not to              attack as a substantive due process matter which is all              thats here                         Yes                         Under Carlson                           Yes  think under Carlson there              was review of those individualized custody determinations                         No that is absolutely correct                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             but the  again coming back to the central issue in this               case all that is at issue here is whether the Attorney               Generals detention pursuant to expressed statutory               authority is reasonably related to the goals that have               been advanced and as long as the person was found by the               Attorney General to be dangerous or a flight risk the               detention is reasonably related and that detention is               subject to periodic automatic review by the Attorney               General every year and in intervening periods the alien              can request a review of his status by presenting changed              material circumstances                        In that situation we think that is a very              reasonable response on behalf of the two political              branches about how to deal with the severe problem of              dangerous criminal aliens in our midst                        It is an inherent part of the sovereignty of              every nation to protect itself against aliens who that              nation does not believe should be in its presence for              purposes of national sovereignty national security but              also the safety of the populace of that country and that              is what Congress and the Attorney General are responding              to                        Safety is not simply a question to be addressed              by the States  When it comes to aliens in this country              it is Congress responsibility not that of the States or                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             in addition to that of the States to protect the populace               of the United States against the presence of dangerous               criminal aliens in the United States and that is what has               been done here on the basis of a criminal prosecution and               administrative procedures that unquestionably satisfied               due process and the only remaining  in terms of giving               Congress an interest with respect to aliens it is the               equivalent of a States interest with respect to the               mentally ill                        In that situation it is directly parallel to              the interests of a State  When does a State come in and              intervene with respect to the liberty interest of an              individual  With respect to civil commitment it is in              the context of mental illness which gives the State a              right to come in and look after the individual and protect              the individual and the State  With respect to aliens it              is Congress plenary power                        That has been satisfied  That has been              permanently extinguished that liberty interest  All that              remains then is the question of dangerousness and as              this Court has held in the civil commitment cases a State              may place on the alien the burden of showing that he is no              longer dangerous at the end of a particular period                        There have been no questions here about the              statutory authority of the Attorney General to detain the                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             aliens but we think it is clear that the Attorney General               has that authority conferred by Congress
