                                    Mr Chief Justice and may it please     the Court  The Ninth Circuit in our view made two     critical mistakes in applying the Disabilities Act to this     type of claim by a professional athlete First it failed     to recognize that Title  of the act the public     accommodations provision apply only to claims by persons     seeking to obtain inputs of a place of public     accommodation that is seeking to enjoy its goods or     services not to claims by persons seeking to supply     inputs as employees or independent contractors               Second the Ninth Circuit never took account of     just what a toplevel professional sport really is     nothing more or less than a competition that tests     excellence in performing what its rules require  Any     attempt to adjust the rules to compensate for an     individual players physical condition fundamentally     alters the nature of that competition               Now in turning to the first issue our position     is simply this  That Title  of the act would not apply                                      if Respondent were playing in tour events as an employee    of the Tour and the results should be no different just     because he is playing in the events                 Thats correct Justice OConnor      mean the argument                 Thats correct  The argument made by     Respondent is essentially that Title  covers any person     who is present at a place of public accommodation     whatever he or she is doing there whether they are a     customer an employee or an independent contractor      think thats wrong for several reasons               First of all just looking at the specific     language that you point to the notion of full and equal     enjoyment of goods and services it seems to me is quite     different from the notion of being allowed to provide the     goods and services                Thats correct Justice OConnor      mean the argument                 Thats correct  The argument made by     Respondent is essentially that Title  covers any person     who is present at a place of public accommodation     whatever he or she is doing there whether they are a     customer an employee or an independent contractor      think thats wrong for several reasons               First of all just looking at the specific     language that you point to the notion of full and equal     enjoyment of goods and services it seems to me is quite     different from the notion of being allowed to provide the     goods and services                Well if may separate this into two     things because the  applies only to a very small     piece which is the qualifying tournament There is no     requirement playing on the Tour itself or on the Nike     Tour                But thats where one starts But in     terms of privilege Im using the term goods and services     not to skip over the others but simply as a shorthand     reference to all of that                Well except for it seems to me that                                      in fact the word privilege if it means the privilege to    work for a place of public accommodation to provide the     input of labor to a place of public accommodation then     naturally following that logic Title  would apply to     anybody an employee an independent contractor or anyone                Well think it does to be honest     with you Justice Souter  For example this happens to be     a game of golf  But if one thinks of the game of     football for example professional football is a game     that is played by employees  They are they are hired     think basically by the teams They compete against each     other                Well it depends on performance but     in a very specific sense of course the performance by any     professional athlete determines ultimately what he or she     gets paid  So if in fact one can say it is a privilege of     a place of public accommodation to be able to compete in a     professional sport then it seems to me that would apply     to any professional sport                Im not sure what difference that     makes Justice Souter because in a sense anybody can     compete to play on a professional football team  mean     professional football teams are drawn from the public at                                      large                 if they are good enough to     qualify                Well the  the thing that think     makes it more confusing it seems is that normally our     position would be that the opportunity to earn something     to start with without using the words win a prize from     it but the opportunity to earn something would not be the     kind of privilege or good or service that is being offered     by a place of public accommodation  Indeed people who     want to provide the inputs would be the kinds of people     who wanted to provide services and earn what they would     get in return  think what makes this case seem     different is because what Respondent in fact does for a                                      living is something that other people do for recreational    purposes or part of educational purposes               But again to take an example if the Tour     constructed its operation just slightly differently     instead of saying we will have everybody just compete for     the prizes as independent contractors if they said what     we will do is we will hire a group of approximately      professional golfers well make them employees well pay     them a modest salary just enough to kind of cover their     expenses as they play and then whatever they win over and     above that that will be their earnings               Now our argument would be that in that     arrangement the Tour would clearly not be subject to     suits by those golfers under Title                 They might be subject to suit                 Because Title  is the title of this     Act that deals with that kind of issue the question of     relationships between people who are providing labor and     the people who are paying for it                think it makes a                 think the difference between the     examples you are using Justice Breyer and this example     is those the people who go to the race tracks some of     whom may go to make a living are essentially doing the     same thing receiving the same outputs if you will from     the race track as the people who are there simply for     recreational purposes                But but think the difference     Justice Breyer is that at the time the tournament is     going on in fact there are no people there playing for                                     recreational purposes  During the time of the tournament    which is the time when the is operating the place of     public accommodation thats whats bringing the     within Title  with respect to the spectators for     example is because its operating a particular tournament     at a place of public accommodation  It seems to me                 Thats correct                Well Title  does not apply we     believe in the same circumstances as we dont think Title      of the applies to situations in which somebody is     simply seeking to provide seeking to obtain employment or     trying to obtain work as an independent contractor so     Title  of the Civil Rights Act would not apply in that     case                For both those situations  Now of    course the  the disabilities act itself and of course     the Civil Rights Acts that apply to race and sex and age     have provisions that deal specifically with the question     of who is working at different places and claims about     discrimination saying the terms and conditions that you     have set for a particular job are discriminating against     me                Under the disabilities act and not     under Title   Whether there are other provisions like     Section  for example in the case of race might     extend protection in that situation                The public accommodations provisions     in our view are intended again to deal with essentially     people who are consumers clients and customers                It is a modified version of the     second Justice Stevens  It is that they are not     individuals seeking full and equal enjoyment of goods     services privilege and accommodations as those terms are     properly interpreted                That the area generally  There is a     difficulty  mean one of the questions that one has is     is every piece of the property a place of public     accommodation or is the  are the ropes for example     dividing a place of public accommodation from a place that     isnt  That is one way to look at it               In our view the simpler way to look at it is     the second way that you have which is to say you have to     be asking in this question is the person an individual     receiving the kind of goods services and privileges that     are covered                But thats because thats because     they clearly are  The Tour doesnt deny Its putting on     an entertainment  It is putting on an entertainment to     which spectators are allowed so if one asks is the golf     course at this moment a place of exercise or recreation     as thats typically thought of under Title  our answer     would be think the better view is no  And the Ninth     Circuit actually interestingly didnt say that it was a     place of exercise or recreation and noted that we made the     argument it wasnt and basically said be that as it may     it is a place of entertainment and we  and what we are     saying is yes it is a place of entertainment and there     are people present at the tournaments who in fact are     enjoying goods and service and enjoying the entertainment     that we are providing                But the golfers are part of the     entertainment  Excuse me                Thats correct                Well Justice Kennedy Im not sure     agree with that  mean if if  the thing that makes     the Tour have the obligations to the spectators is the     fact that they are operating a place of public     accommodation during the tournaments You have to be     operating a place of public accommodation before you     become subject to Title                 But Justice Kennedy the Tour isnt     an abstraction  The Tour literally is are a series of     events put on by a c organization a nonstock     membership organization and they are put on for the     purposes of providing entertainment to the public  That     entertainment it seems to me is a product that they                                     offer at a place of public accommodation               Yes Justice OConnor  Let me talk     about that now if may  The  if one assumes for a     moment and for example the Seventh Circuit in the     Olinger case just assumed that Title  did apply to the     type of claim that the professional golfer there made  If     one assumes that then the question is whether the     modification thats requested here would fundamentally     alter the nature of Tour events and think that where     the Ninth Circuit went wrong on that particular question     is that it never really came to grips with what     professional athletics are               The professional athletics are as said in the     beginning simply tests of excellence  They are questions     of who can perform the best a particular set of physical     tasks and those tasks are defined by the rules of the     sport                Not  never in a highlevel Tour     event Your Honor  There has never been a situation in     the events we are talking about which is the events on     the highest level tours where they have allowed     different people                 Oh qualifying tours                 Well because the the principal     events that they put on are of course the events of the     Tour themselves the two highest level events  Qualifying     involves simply questions of logistics to be honest      There are there are many more people who are playing                Well first of all let me make                 Well let me make one point That                                     when carts are allowed they are allowed for all players    and that is essentially because there are choices that the     Tour has to make at any particular time about whether or     not there are enough caddies available whether there is     enough time on the golf course to get however many people     there are through the event in order to produce whatever     result they are looking for               With respect to the events we are talking about     the actual competitions on the Tour on the buycom     Tour which is the second level tour the Tour has always     required that all competitors observe all the same rules     including the walking rule There have been no exceptions     to that whatsoever                want to make clear two points      First of all that when talk about rules am talking     about what we have called in the case substantive rules      And that is rules that are intended to and do have the     potential to affect performance and the outcome of the     tournament  So first of all when Im using the term                                     rules am              Secondly though the question is if if you are     saying do we mean that for any rule or any accommodation     think the correct answer is yes although one sort of     instinctively would think that there should be some     process by which people can separate the performance     affecting rules that really count from the performance     affecting rules that dont really count  actually dont     think there is such a process                In a professional sport think     thats true that the purpose of a professional sport is     one thing and one thing only  Its to determine who is     the best at doing a certain set of defined tasks  If you     change what the tasks are if you change the rules that     people have to comply with so that you have different     rules for different players you are not going to get an     answer to the question of who is the best at that     particular thing                think our second argument is     slightly different Justice Scalia  agree with the     first part to start with  Yes  think if the Court     would agree on the first issue that the Tour could and     think the Tour could under the second simply by changing     what the rules of the sport are  Our position is not that     there is such a thing                 But then you                 think its  again our argument     just to make sure Im being clear is not that we are     contesting contending that there is a difference that     there are fundamental rules and nonfundamental rules  We     can tell which one is which and walking is a fundamental     rule  If there were such a way to tell we think walking     would be a fundamental rule  But our position in fact is     that all the substantive rules are fundamental rules                Rules are rules                You cannot because you absolutely                 You have to have the uniformity in     order to be able to measure what you do                Im sorry Justice Stevens                That what is fundamental                  yes  Except again want     want to be clear that what in fact is fundamental to any     particular game is the rules of the sport  That is what     defines what the sport is Therefore if there is not a     rule against it by definition its not something that     potentially affects the outcome of the sport as played     under its rules                Pardon me                think the difference in amateur     sports and the thing that makes makes the when you apply     the fundamental alteration language is that the     fundamental when you talk about fundamentally altering     the nature of a particular good or service that requires     looking at what the nature of the particular good or     service is  The nature of a professional sport is very     different think from the nature of most amateur     sports Probably not all                                                Not only that  mean amateur     sports do that to some extent as well but amateur sports     by definition and particularly high school college     grade school sports things like that have as part of     their very nature part of their very reason for being an     educational or recreational side  And therefore when one     comes to apply any fundamentally altered language to the     nature of that essentially amateur sports most amateur     sports have a dual nature  They have a nature that     involves sort of sorting winners from losers but they     also have a nature that says we are trying to get as many     kids in the high school or whatever to play  Professional     sports are not                 Well if its actually changing what                                     the good or service is                Well if it changes the nature then     though think one therefore one has to look at the     regulations for some guidance  And the regulations  Id     like to take just a minute before reserve my time if     may but the regulations are something that because the     United States hasnt cited them think maybe get lost a     little bit here  But under the regulations in Title      there is a specific provision that says a public     accommodation does not have to change its inventory to     accommodate disabled people  And the reason given for     that in the preamble of the regulations is that Title      requirements are intended to assure access to the goods     and services being provided not to alter the mix in     nature of the services typically provided               Now typically provided in this context we would     say are the tournaments with uniform rules including the     walking rule at the very highest level  That is one that     has been typically provided               And the reason think for that and think     this goes to your question Justice Breyer is that in a     sense any store or commercial entity is just whatever its     goods are a bookstore  An example is a bookstore does     not have to stock braille braille books  And there isnt                                     an inquiry every time as to how much trouble it would be    to stock braille books whether theres shelf space     whether they could get them or not  Theres a categorical     rule in the regulations that says thats not what were     talking about that would be a fundamental alteration and     thats exactly the same point we are making here               If may Id like to reserve the balance of my     time                                                    Thank you Mr Chief Justice Excuse     me  Just a few brief points               Responding in reverse order to the United     States argument first of all they say that the reason     that employers employees are not covered by Title  is     because that covers Title  but Title  doesnt cover all     employees  It only covers employees of a covered     employer  You have to have at least  employees to be     covered and if you are not an employee of a covered     employer you are not covered either  Yet the United     States position is that no employees are covered by Title      but really independent contractors or people similar to     that are in the same position essentially with respect to     Title  as noncovered employees under Title                Secondly the district court specifically said     that Respondent was an independent contractor not just in     talking about Title  but on page  of the joint                                     appendix it says the district court says focus only    on the issue of whether he is entitled to his requested     accommodation the use of a golf cart as an independent     contractor playing in defendants tournaments which are     held at places of public accommodation               Now  but should point out mean while he     is an independent contractor as defined by the district     court our point is not exactly it turns on whether he is     an employee or an independent contractor  Our point is he     is not a consumer of goods and services and there are a     number of people who are not consumers  Employees are in     the group Independent contractors are in the group      Partners in a law firm which is a type of public     accommodation are not in the group  Insurance agents are     not in the group  The issue is what they are not  They     are not people obtaining seeking to obtain or gain access     to goods and services  They are all in the category of     people who are providing goods and services to the public     accommodation so it in turn can provide its goods and     services to other people               Secondly just to make the contrast between the     people who are also playing golf and who are covered     Title  we concede it covers commercial opportunities     recreational opportunities educational opportunities      Those are all things specifically mentioned in Title  in                                     terms of defining whos a public accommodation  What  it    doesnt cover is professional opportunities the people     who are trying to get to make their living essentially     working for the place the operator the public     accommodation  So they are not like the tout at the race     track who is there in common with the other people     enjoying it for recreation  They are people actually     working like somebody who is behind the betting counter at     the race track who is working for the operator               Now just quickly on the points that Respondent     raises Rule  doesnt say golf is a sport of hitting     the ball from the tee to the putting hole  It says its a     game of hitting it from the tee to the putting hole in     accordance with the rules That is Rule                And the rules for this particular competition     include as there are permitted to be optional rules and     that in turn includes the requirement that competitors     walk the course  So if you if you are saying that you     cannot that you have to make waivers in that situation     for someone who cant comply then you are changing the     game
